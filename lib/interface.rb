    puts <<~WELCOME 
      ⭐️ Welcome to the Mastermind game.
      You will play against the computer.
      Computer will generate a secret code.
      You have #{Configuration::NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS} guesses to try to 
      crack the secret code. After each guess,
      if you haven't cracked the code yet, you will see 
      a history of your guesses and hints to help you. 
    WELCOME
  end

  def guess
    puts <<~REQUEST
    🔥 What's your guess?
    Guess a combination of #{Configuration::CODE_LENGTH} colors. 
    Valid colors are #{Configuration::CODE_VALUES.join('')}. 
    You will enter your guess in a format like this: #{SecretCode.generate.join('')}. 
    🆙 Type in your guess:
    REQUEST
    get_guess
  end
  
  def guess_again
    puts <<~REQUEST
    Invalid guess. Guess a combination of #{Configuration::CODE_LENGTH} colors. 
    Valid colors are #{Configuration::CODE_VALUES.join('')}. 
    An example guess is #{SecretCode.generate.join('')}. Guess again.
